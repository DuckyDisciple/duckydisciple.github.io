blurb: >
  Drew has been creating, developing, and exploring the coding world for over 10 years. What started as a passion for making some of the
   weirdest, yet somehow entertaining flash games eventually turned into developing websites, web and Android apps, and creating solutions
   for any technological issue. Drew also has a heart for church planting and spends a lot of time creating and developing systems 
   that help support the vision of the church.
